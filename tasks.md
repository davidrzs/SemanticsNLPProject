# Tasks

### What the report expects:

- [ ] explain what we did so far and plans for the future
- [ ] draft of the introduction
- [ ] a literature review (including comments on related work)
- [ ] preliminary results
    - [ ] baseline system performance (SIFT + another one?)
    - [ ] dataset statistics
- [ ] any changes from the original plan

### Things that need to get done for the report:

- [ ] a

### This is a (general?) list of tasks we need to tackle:

- [ ] Getting Datasets to Work (e.g. Hans still needs to be added and preprocessed like the others) @David started this but seems to be a hard task
- [ ] Check why model requires massively more memory when performing certain tasks
- [ ] Get stuff to run on Euler Cluster (preferrably have a system where we can quickly deploy to Euler and don't need to spend 30 mins configuring each time) @Matthias wrote some comments already in the cluster_readme.md
- [ ] Very thourough literature review
- [ ] Build a pipeline which preprocesses the datasets into AMR graphs for loading (still needs to be done but coordinate with David who works on the dataset preprocessing pipeline above & coordinate with Matthias who is reading in the pickled )
- [ ] Think about how exactly we build our graph from the AMR (maybe we should do this later, )
- [ ] load in preprocessed AMR graphs (@Matthias started this)
- [ ]
