# Repository for *Towards a Deeper Understanding of Semantic Comprehension in Language Models Paired with Semantic Graphs*

This repository contains the code for our semester project for the ETH course [Computational Semantics for Natural Language Processing](http://www.mrinmaya.io/teaching_csnlp22).


It consists of three parts:

- [AMR Preprocessing](AMRDatasetCreator/README.md)
- [A SIFT Fork (https://github.com/ZhaofengWu/SIFT)](SIFT/README.md)
